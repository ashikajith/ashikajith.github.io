Hi Guys, My name is Ashik Ajith and I have over 6 of experience as a Software Developer and have been worked at both small startup's and MNC companies. While I am a proficient full-stack developer, my expertise is in building scalable back-end services using Ruby on Rails.

For the last couple of years I have been focusing on full stack development in RoR, I intend to keep an eye on other technology stack like Vue.js React.js and do whatever it takes to get things done properly.

Well Thats all about me....
